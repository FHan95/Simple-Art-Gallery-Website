# Simple Art Gallery Website

A simple art gallery website that incorporates JavaScript and PHP alongside HTML.

The main page of the website (home.php) contains links for "Home", "About Us", and "Blogs" at the top of the page. There are also three drop down lists for "Art Works", "Artists", and "Museums", which all have 5 items each. Finally, there is a "Shopping Cart" icon at the top of the page.

By selecting any item on the list of Art Works, two windows will appear at the center and right part of the main page which includes an image of the artwork and brief information respectively. By clicking on the name of the artwork in the brief information window, the user is redirected to a new window containing a larger size image of the artwork accompanied by more detailed information.

By selecting any item on the list of Artists, two windows will appear at the center and right part of the main page which includes an image of the artist and brief information respectively. By clicking on the name of the artist in the brief information window, the user is redirected to a new window containing a larger size image of the artist accompanied by more detailed information.

The "Shopping Cart" icon only appears in the main page and retrieves the user's order parameters. This part revolves around the use of PHP's sessions funtionality to keep track of the current user's orders.
